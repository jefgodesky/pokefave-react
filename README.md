# PokéFave
React Version

The assignment: create a webpage that lists the Pokémon from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and let users mark their favorites. Having originally done this as a React project, I later thought that a side-by-side comparison of what it would look like as [a modern example of progressive enhancement](https://github.com/jefgodesky/pokefave-progressive) seemed like something that could be useful and interesting.
